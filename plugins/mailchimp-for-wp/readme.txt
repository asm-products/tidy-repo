**What is MailChimp?**

As this plugin is an integration for MailChimp, you need to have a MailChimp account to be able to use it. MailChimp is a newsletter service that allows you to send out email campaigns to lists of email subscribers.

MailChimp is free for lists up to 2000 subscribers, which is why MailChimp is the go-to choice for small businesses or starting entrepeneurs. That doesn't mean MailChimp is not a great choice for bigger businesses though.

If you do not yet have a MailChimp account, [registering for MailChimp is free and only takes you about 30 seconds](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup).

= How to display a form in posts or pages? =
Use the `[mc4wp_form]` shortcode.

= How to display a form in widget areas like a sidebar? =
Use the **MailChimp for WP Form** Widget that comes with the plugin.

= How to display a form in my template files? =
Use the `mc4wp_form()` function.

`
if( function_exists( 'mc4wp_form' ) ) {
	mc4wp_form();
}
`

= I am getting spam sign-ups =

To prevent bots from subscribing, you can take the following anti-spam measures.

- Enable double opt-in in the plugin settings.
- Install the [Goodbye Captcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/goodbye-captcha/) plugin.

= Oops. Something went wrong. =
`Admin notice: FNAME must be provided - Please enter a value`

Your selected MailChimp list requires a field named **FNAME**. Either go into your MailChimp list settings and make the FNAME field optional or add it to your form (using the *Add MailChimp field** select box).

= The form shows a success message but subscribers are not added to my list(s)? =
If the form shows a success message, it means MailChimp accepted the sign-up request and will take over from there. MailChimp could have a slight delay sending the confirmation email though, please just be patient.

= How can I style the sign-up form? =
You can use CSS rules to style the sign-up form, use the following CSS selectors to target the various form elements.

`
.mc4wp-form { ... } /* the form element */
.mc4wp-form p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
.mc4wp-form label { ... } /* labels */
.mc4wp-form input { ... } /* input fields */
.mc4wp-form input[type="checkbox"] { ... } /* checkboxes */
.mc4wp-form input[type="submit"] { ... } /* submit button */
.mc4wp-alert { ... } /* success & error messages */
.mc4wp-success { ... } /* success message */
.mc4wp-error { ... } /* error messages */
`

Add your custom CSS rules to the end of your theme stylesheet, **/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/style.css**. Do not add them to the plugin stylesheet as they will be automatically overwritten on the next plugin update.

[>> With the Pro plugin it's really easy to design beautiful forms <<](https://mc4wp.com/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=after-css-link)

= Where can I find my MailChimp API key? =
[You can find your MailChimp API key here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key)

= How to add a sign-up checkbox to my Contact Form 7 forms? =
Use the following shortcode in your CF7 form mark-up to display a sign-up checkbox.

`[mc4wp_checkbox "My custom label text"]`

You can then use `[mc4wp_checkbox]` inside your CF7 email templates, it will show "yes" or "no".

If you need more data for your merge fields, prefix the field name with `mc4wp-`.

*Example CF7 template for MailChimp WEBSITE field*
`
[text* mc4wp-WEBSITE]
`

= Can I add a checkbox to third-party forms? =
Yes. Just include a checkbox with name attribute `mc4wp-subscribe` and value `1` in your form.

*Example HTML*
`
<label><input type="checkbox" name="mc4wp-subscribe" value="1" /> Subscribe to our newsletter?</label>
`

If you need to send more data to your MailChimp list, prefix the name attribute with `mc4wp-`.

*Example HTML code for MailChimp list field called WEBSITE*
`
<label>Your website:</label>
<input type="text" name="mc4wp-WEBSITE" />
`

= How do I add subscribers to certain interest groups? =
Use the field wizard. Or, if you know more about HTML, the following snippet should get you started. *Replace `###` with your grouping ID or grouping name.*

`
<label><input type="checkbox" name="GROUPINGS[###][]" value="Group 1" /> Group 1</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" name="GROUPINGS[###][]" value="Group 2" /> Group 2</label>
`
Or, if you want to use a hidden field...

`
<input type="hidden" name="GROUPINGS[###]" value="Groupname 1,Groupname 2,Groupname 3" />
`

= I don't see new subscribers but they are still added to my list =
When you have double opt-in disabled, new subscribers will be seen as *imports* by MailChimp. They will not show up in your daily digest emails or statistics. My recommendation is to leave double opt-in enabled.

= Can I add more (hidden) fields to the sign-up checkbox? =
Not at the moment, but you can add more data using a filter. Here is a code snippet to [add grouping information to comment form sign-ups](https://gist.github.com/dannyvankooten/7120559).

= How do I add a Captcha to my forms? =
Install the [BWS Captcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha/) plugin, then use `[captcha]` inside your form mark-up.

= How do I add a checkbox to my Events Manager booking form? =
Add a checkbox field to your booking form and name it `mc4wp-subscribe`.

Optionally, add more MailChimp fields by prefixing the MailChimp list field name with `mc4wp-`, eg `mc4wp-website`.

= Why does the checkbox not show up at my comment form? =
Your theme probably does not support the necessary comment hook this plugin uses to add the checkbox to your comment form. You can manually place the checkbox by placing the following code snippet inside the form tags of your theme's comment form.

`<?php if( function_exists( 'mc4wp_checkbox' ) ) { mc4wp_checkbox(); }?>`

Your theme folder can be found by browsing to `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/`.
